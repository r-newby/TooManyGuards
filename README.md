This project is a fun, data-driven exploration of WNBA Draft picks from 2020 to 2024. Using data on player position, drafting team, and draft round, I analyze trends in who gets waived and why. I also use machine learning with Scikit-learn to predict whether a player is likely to be waived before playing for their team.
